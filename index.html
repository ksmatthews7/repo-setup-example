          <h1>Never the Same</h1>
          <p>Picture this: you're in an arena, filled with many types of different people, celebrating your team as they score a basket or make a stop on defense. Unfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic has kept this from happening for the majority
            of 2020. However, the good thing is that sports leagues around the world are adopting to create new experiences that can help their fans safely
            enjoy the content these leagues produce. There are some changes the NBA, in particular, could make, that could give their fans an unforgettable experience.</p>

          <p>are trying to find ways to monetize it.
            The NBA could start to use betting technology in arenas to allow fans to be engaged in the game while also making money off of it at the same time.
            David Torromeo, executive director of the Sport Business Masters at Manhattanville College, mentioned this as something the league could look into,
            allowing fans to do things like bet on who might make the next basket, straight from their seats.</p>

          <p>Tailgating has taken on a whole new importance in sports, as fans look to be outside to celebrate their team
            in a safer way than being indoors. As a result, teams may look to give fans a deeper experience in these outdoor tailgating spaces,
            so that they can still feel connected to the team. Dr. Daniel Kelly, academic director for the Tisch Institute for Global Sport at the NYU School
            of Professional Studies mentioned this idea and said that the Milwaukee Bucks have been a team that has stepped up to do something like this.</p>

          <p>Virtual and augmented reality were already gaining traction around the league, but they could find new found popularity in a world that promotes social distancing as the NBA looks for ways to gain revenue. Fans could receive headsets
            that give them the feeling of being in the arena right from home. Closely related to this is how fans
            could watch games from their home, and have their images come up in the stands at games. The video below shows how Microsoft and the
            NBA planned to do this in the NBA's return to play in 2020 in Orlando.</p>

        <p class="fixed">These are just a few of the changes the league could implement to make the fan's experience different from the past.
          In the future, we may see even more, and this pandemic could prove to help the league grow its platform in ways that it never thought of before.</p>
